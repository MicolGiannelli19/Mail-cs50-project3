note: undefined object 

Concepts learned, Using a conbination of django and Javasctipt:
 - Using asychrounous javascript to only dynamically load the information when it is needed
  
- Find out how to clear databases with django 
- todo: sort out the history thing so you can go back to the right place 

TODO: Make archive button function  
TODO: move emails to read once you have opened them

All that is left to do is the making PUT request to the emails thing this is easy and basically the same 

One thing that I am unsure about is finding a way for when you click the archive button to avoid running the view email funciton
